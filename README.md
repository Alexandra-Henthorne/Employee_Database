* By looking at the above photo and using SQL to  breakdown the data we were able to create a table that showed us how many people were retiring per title. This helped us see which department or branch was loosing the most employees to retirement. 
* This table essentially broke down the number of employees in the company as a number instead of a person. It didnt give us much data other than to show were HR might need to start setting up job opportunities or begin to promote .

* Once that was broken down we could then see who was eligible for the mentorship based off of their employment. 
* This table showed us when they were hired, their employee number, as well as their title and deprtment . It essentially dug deeper into the person that was retiring instead of just showing the position and the number of employees with that title that were retiring in the company 


Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
After adding up all employees in all departments that are eligible for retirement was 33,118. That is why it is being referred to as the "silver tsunami" because the company is loosing roughly about 14 percent of employees. There is an average of about 60 thousand employees that retire a year, this company alone is loosing half of that . Which is a lot and detrimental to the company. 

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
